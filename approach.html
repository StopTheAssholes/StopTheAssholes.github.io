                    <p class="land-text">We are not a special interest group, focused on single-perspective issues or targeted advocacy. Rather, we are a group pushing for larger changes within the administration and campus decision-making. Thus, we support other organizations, connect their efforts, and build a factual basis for all groups to understand how campus administrators are responding to and managing changes over time. Our strategies are meant to construct structures of accountability and transparency between administration, faculty, staff, and students. 
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately our goals are to give more power to the faculty and students over administrative decisions and further give more power to students within departments to hold faculty accountable. We believe there are too many outstanding issues of accountability to advocate for one particular point (e.g., campus social climate, graduate student grievances, international student support, teaching quality). Thus, given the students’ and faculty’s primary role in funding this campus (tuition: 43.18%; grants: 20.01%), we believe they should have a say in how the campus is governed: Where our money is invested, how teachers are hired and reprimanded, and actionable accountability on holding to our bespoke values.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <ol class="land-text">
                        <li>Power changing hands through role abdication when accountability metrics are low</li>
                        <li>Review boards occupied by students and faculty to assess grievance mitigations and rate quality of response.</li>
                        <li>Probation and review for faculty and administration who go against our campus values and integrity</li>
                        <li>Transparency around misconduct reporting</li>
                        <li>Improved communication so all parties have equal information when treading through our bureaucracy to solve an issue</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="land-text">Being a broad initiative, we use many strategies to support the campus and place pressure on administrators. Some of them include working with local and national media outlets, supporting campus rallies and demonstrations, spread factual information about corruption and integrity concerns, and aiding allied groups into consensus networks to improve each of their relative power.
