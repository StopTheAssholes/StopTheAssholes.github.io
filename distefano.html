                    <ol class="land-text">
                        <li>Despite growing concern over access issues for lower-income students to CU Boulder, <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/ci_16319168">DiStefano disapproved of capping our rising tuition</a> against the Regent's Boards interest in doing so.</li>
                        <li>Let's further consider that part of DiStefano's claims toward better accounability and access via the Flagship 2030 plan was that he made a <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/flagship2030/progress-date">"Permanent Engagement Structure" to create productive dialogue between students, faculty, and staff.</a> Unfortunately, despite his claims of progress, the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/pesforum/meeting-
schedule">PERMANENT engagement structure hasn't met since 2012</a></li>
                        <li>Just recently, DiStefano likened the tactics of <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/today/2016/11/30/two-student-organizations-invite-conservative-journalist-milo-yiannopoulos-speak-cu">hate blogger Milo Yiannopoulis to inviting a supreme court justice to campus.</a> He said discrimination and harrassment have no place on campus; though Milo, in his talk, encouraged fat people to kill themselves and said "being Muslim is almost as stupid as being fat."</li>
                        <li>In case you wonder how accounable DiStefano is, let's consider his recent apology for a domestic violence case that was brought to his desk, but decided wasn't worth investigating. But hey, <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/today/2017/02/03/chancellors-corner-lessons-learned-handling-tumpkin-domestic-violence-case">he apologized so, I guess, he cares..</a></li>
